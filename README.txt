The idea of the project is to analyze NBA players' data from the 2017-2018 NBA season 
and draw certain conclusions and relationships between different parameters.

The project would also address certain questions , such as:

1)Is there a definite relationship between salary of a player and his shot accureacy , 3 pointer, steal , block, rebound, etc.

2)Do NBA players who have better draft picks shine more than those who had worse draft picks? And if so, do they earn more?

3)As NBA players age, does their accuracy decrease, and do they take more 3 pointers?

4)At what age do NBA players usually reach their prime?

5)In what age group do most NBA players lie in?


The linear regression model would also predict the salary of an NBA player from certain inputted attributes
